# Reinforced Outrun

This is a self made project where I have implemented an autonomous Outrun player. The player developed itself using reinforcement learning over Gens Emulator.

In order to make yourself a player, you have to install in your virtual machine (recommend) the following python Libraries:
 
```
tensorflow
pyautogui
mss
cv2
asyncio
evdev
```

And, of course, have microsoft Xbox 360 controller (or any other controller, I really don't know). This is because the program always hooks the controller in order to output the desired buttons generated by the neural network.

Here you can see some schematics of how the it is working:
